/**
 * POST /api/order. The only route on the site with a side effect.
 *
 * The response vocabulary is deliberately small, because CartView has to be
 * honest about each case and honesty needs to know which case it is in:
 *
 *   200 { ok: true,  number }        the shop's inbox has the ticket
 *   400 { ok: false, error }         the order itself is wrong; fix and resubmit
 *   503 { ok: false, reason: "unconfigured" }   mail was never set up here
 *   502 { ok: false, reason: "send-failed" }    mail is set up and did not work
 *
 * 503 and 502 both mean "your order did not reach the shop", and the cart says
 * exactly that and hands over the phone number and a prefilled email. What it
 * never does is thank the visitor for an order nobody received. See the long
 * comment in lib/intake.ts for why this diverges from glaze.md's contact-form
 * rule.
 *
 * Runs on Node, not edge: nodemailer speaks raw SMTP sockets.
